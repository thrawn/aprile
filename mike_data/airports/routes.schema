As of January 2012, the OpenFlights/Airline Route Mapper Route Database contains
59036 routes between 3209 airports on 531 airlines spanning the globe, as shown
in the map above. Each entry contains the following information:
Airline 2-letter (IATA) or 3-letter (ICAO) code of the airline.
Airline ID  Unique OpenFlights identifier for airline (see Airline).
Source airport  3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the source airport.
Source airport ID   Unique OpenFlights identifier for source airport (see
Airport)
Destination airport 3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the destination
airport.
Destination airport ID  Unique OpenFlights identifier for destination airport
(see Airport)
Codeshare   "Y" if this flight is a codeshare (that is, not operated by Airline,
but another carrier), empty otherwise.
Stops   Number of stops on this flight ("0" for direct)
Equipment   3-letter codes for plane type(s) generally used on this flight,
separated by spaces
The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded. The special value \N is used for
"NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically
by MySQL if imported.
Notes:
Routes are directional: if an airline operates services from A to B and from B
to A, both A-B and B-A are listed separately.
Routes where one carrier operates both its own and codeshare flights are listed
only once.
