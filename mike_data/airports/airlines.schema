Airline database
As of January 2012, the OpenFlights Airlines Database contains 5888 airlines.
Each entry contains the following information:
Airline ID  Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airline.
Name    Name of the airline.
Alias   Alias of the airline. For example, All Nippon Airways is commonly known
as "ANA".
IATA    2-letter IATA code, if available.
ICAO    3-letter ICAO code, if available.
Callsign    Airline callsign.
Country Country or territory where airline is incorporated.
Active  "Y" if the airline is or has until recently been operational, "N" if it
is defunct. This field is not reliable: in particular, major airlines that
stopped flying long ago, but have not had their IATA code reassigned (eg.
Ansett/AN), will incorrectly show as "Y".
The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded. The special value \N is used for
"NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically
by MySQL if imported.
Notes: Airlines with null codes/callsigns/countries generally represent
user-added airlines. Since the data is intended primarily for current flights,
defunct IATA codes are generally not included. For example, "Sabena" is not
listed with a SN IATA code, since "SN" is presently used by its successor
Brussels Airlines.
